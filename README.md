# Hi, I'm Subin 👋


I am an IPMA Level C certified Project manager with 12 years of experience in the Energy / Infrastructure domain. I work for NTPC Ltd., India's largest power producer. I build power plants and air pollution control systems AFK. I have Thermal, Solar and Wind power projects in my portfolio.


Prior to my current job, I worked as a data analyst for the world’s largest pure-play data analytics firm. Before that, I had a sprint in automobile R&D, calibrating common rail diesel engines on the Bosch EDC platform.
