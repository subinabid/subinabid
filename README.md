I am the co-founder and Product Manager at AlphaGeek, building Zerowatt energy Intelligence system. I love software and enjoy writing Python.

Before that, I worked as a data analyst for the worldâ€™s largest pure-play data analytics firm. I had a sprint in automobile R&D at Mahindra & Mahindra, calibrating common rail diesel engines on the Bosch EDC platform.
